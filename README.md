# 🔒 Directory Encryption Tool

Welcome to the **Directory Encryption Tool**, a sophisticated application designed to **encrypt** and **decrypt** files within a directory seamlessly. This project leverages the power of **Flet** to provide an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) and utilizes **pyAesCrypt** for robust AES-256 encryption.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔒 Encrypt All Files**: Securely encrypt all files in a selected directory.
- **🔓 Decrypt Files**: Easily decrypt files using a password, restoring them to their original form.
- **💬 User Notifications**: Receive clear success and error messages for every operation, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **🌈 Customizable Interface**: Enjoy a visually appealing interface with adjustable themes and fonts.
